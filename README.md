Tourism application in Saudi Arabia 

## Project description
The idea of the application is to display the tourist places in Saudi Arabia in conjunction with the vision and the Kingdomâ€™s orientation around tourism, and to focus on the distinctive areas such as Madin Saleh and Madin Shuaib and other places that bear distinct history and stories that many people do not know. 

So that the application helps the tourist to identify the displayed areas, get an idea of the site, and raise the rate of visits to archaeological sites and other unknown areas in the Kingdom.


## Target User
People interested in tourism and exploring distinctive areas and monuments in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.


## User stories
   - Add an introductory text or a brief, pictures, and  about the place.
   - Add a reader to the introductory text in the written place, for people who prefer to listen rather than read.
